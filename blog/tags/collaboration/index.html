                <p>While those on IT side of a CSP (Communications Service Provider) business are quite familiar with cloud management platforms such as ManageIQ, the network side folks are very familiar with Network Function Virtualization Orchestrators (NFV-O) as defined in <a href="http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-MAN/001_099/001/01.01.01_60/gs_NFV-MAN001v010101p.pdf">ETSI MANO</a> spec. These two worlds are converging though and so are their technologies. We came across the presentation on how <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ManageIQ/nfvo-based-on-manageiq-opnfv-summit-2016-demo">ManageIQ can now run as an NFV-O</a> to manage your Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). But what if you are already running a ETSI NFV-O in your environment ? Is there still a place for ManageIQ? Definitely.</p>

                <p>With the recent announcement of Amazon’s <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/config/">AWS Config service</a>, there is a <a href="https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/1049">Pull Request</a> to integrate with it.  The integration will allow ManageIQ to use the AWS Config service as an event source to our Amazon Provider.  These events can be used to drive many things inside ManageIQ, including inventory refreshes, policies and automate workflows.  Once this Pull Request is merged, our appliance (which is built nightly) will have that functionality incorporated.  Until then, if you want to play with the proposed integration, take the code changes from the pull request and integrate them into your appliance or development environment.</p>

                <p>For some time now, Booz Allen Hamilton, one of the founding members of the ManageIQ Community, has been hard at work on a “cloud broker”. “What is a cloud broker,” you may ask? It’s a nice tool that allows individuals to pick and choose various service offerings from multiple sources, without knowing (or caring) which cloud or virtualization platform supplies the services. That they chose ManageIQ as the platform of record to build on speaks volumes to the hard work those engineers have put in over the last 8 years.</p>

Note: Bash doesn’t even need to be the default shell - plenty of ‘Dash’ users are also affected. Luckily, there’s a way to avoid this mess - a policy management engine in ManageIQ, combined with VM fleecing, that lets you route around the vulnerability, turning off VMs that are vulnerable.

                <p>When we originally open-sourced ManageIQ, the <a href="https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq">ManageIQ GitHub
Repo</a> was integrated with <a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/ManageIQ/manageiq">Code
Climate</a>.  Integrating with
Code Climate allowed the developer community to find code with too much
complexity and/or duplication and refactor it.</p>

<p>This week, we integrated the <a href="https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq">ManageIQ GitHub
Repo</a> with <a href="https://travis-ci.org/ManageIQ/manageiq">Travis
CI</a>, the continuous integration
service.  This service runs on each GitHub pull request to ensure that no new
code is breaking existing tests (i.e. no regression).  If the pull request does
cause a regression, the core maintainers of the ManageIQ project will not merge
it until this is resolved.</p>

<p>So, keep creating pull requests to make ManageIQ better, but make sure that they
do not break any tests!</p>
