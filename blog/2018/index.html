      <i>Oh no</i>. Surely they wouldn't have been so foolish as to let <code>d-m-u</code> write <i>yet another one</i>. When will this madness end? They are tempting the very threads of fate herself, letting <code>d-m-u</code> get away with this twice in a row. Who knows what horrors will befall you this time. You shudder. If you are lucky, it will be only physical monsters, not the unearthly disturbances of time and dark and cold that have been evoked with such disasterous results previously. You had held out a smattering of hope that <code>d-m-u's</code> prose might be gentled the way that centuries of water smooth a pebble, but such hope is whisked away with the next thought: you never know, with these texts, if you will exist outside the inky blackness, cursed to only watch as the story dismally unfolds before your eyes, or if you will be a deeply unwilling participant, your agency slave to the whims of an unreliable, mercurial narrator.

    <div class="post-content">
      <p>Since its founding in 2018, Last Month In MIQ has been the absolute golden standard for journalistic integrity, never afraid to grab truth by the scruff of the neck and shake it up a little. Of course, that being said, we do ever so occasionally take a break from our regularly scheduled program to bring you insights into the minds of our crack team here at MIQ. I know you look forward to such rare occasions with baited breath. Best not to think about what it’s baited with.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the current run of our blog has had to be mostly abandoned because of its low visibility and a striking case of writers’ remorse, but we felt that our readers would still want to know a little something of the private lives of our contributors.</p>

    <div class="post-content">
      <p>While those on IT side of a CSP (Communications Service Provider) business are quite familiar with cloud management platforms such as ManageIQ, the network side folks are very familiar with Network Function Virtualization Orchestrators (NFV-O) as defined in <a href="http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-MAN/001_099/001/01.01.01_60/gs_NFV-MAN001v010101p.pdf">ETSI MANO</a> spec. These two worlds are converging though and so are their technologies. We came across the presentation on how <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ManageIQ/nfvo-based-on-manageiq-opnfv-summit-2016-demo">ManageIQ can now run as an NFV-O</a> to manage your Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). But what if you are already running a ETSI NFV-O in your environment ? Is there still a place for ManageIQ? Definitely.</p>

    </header>

    <div class="post-content">
      <p>You wake up. You’re in your house. There’s a gigantic white dog slumbering peacefully with one eye open and a timer that appears to be counting down 120 seconds. You jump up, grab the timer, and run out. You stumble out into a huge monochrome map. North? West? One way is blocked. A minute left. There’s a lighthouse right next to you. You climb as the timer counts down. As the seconds slip away, you find an important quest item at the top of the lighthouse. Congrats! You are holding a <a href="https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/17312">tool to process logs looking for frequency of method calls</a>! Ding! The time is up.</p>

<p>You wake up in your little house. There’s the dog… and oh yeah, you suddenly recall that you got an item yesterday. You look around for it. The dog is drooling all over it in its slumber. You sigh but are afraid to wake the beast. You grab the timer and run outside again. The lighthouse is gone, and the only way open to you today is south. You head south as the timer counts down, pausing to examine a stray catalog item with a tag control element. You see that the item is broken, that you cannot order it as you should be able to. You drop it in frustration. Ding!</p>

<p>You wake up. The dog is nowhere to be seen. Incidentally, your tool to process logs isn’t either, and you wonder ruefully if you should have saved it from its fate. The timer is counting down. You grab it and run, heading south again until you reach your catalog item with a tag control element from yesterday. And lo and behold, it appears <a href="https://github.com/ManageIQ/ui-components/pull/278">to be fully functional</a> today! Marvelling, you barely notice that you’re again out of time.</p>

<p>You wake up. The dog is back. Your process logs tool is beaten up but still mostly intact. You grab it and the timer. The dog stirs but does not wake. You hide the tool in your chest, delighting at the fact that it also contains a new <a href="https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/17351">Openstack Cinder EventCatcher worker</a> and head out again with the timer. This time there appears to be a small river next to your house. You head towards the sound of the water. On the beach are several <a href="https://github.com/ManageIQ/integration_tests/pull/7161">RHV markers</a>. Delighted, you grab them. Ding!</p>

<p>You wake up to a very strange sight. The dog has seemingly grown very long claws and is reading on the floor. You stumble to your feet and back up a few steps hurridly. The beast looks at the ticking timer and barks once, a strange bark infused with the burning smell of charter magic. The timer stops. The dog languidly looks up at you, its paws growing back to their regular size, and noses the book towards you. You stare blankly at the upsidedown page, struggling to decipher the seven words which have appeared in front of your eyes. “<a href="https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-ui-service/pull/1410">Fixes disk size misreporting for some disks</a>”, you read. The dog barks again, and the time is, once again, up.</p>

<p>You wake up. You realize with some dread that a sense of realism, concise documentation, perfecting the art of recognizing and handling abnormal people, moving to the eighth dimension, secret messages from your teeth, knowing every line of <em>Airplane!</em>, the music that is sometimes known as blues, a misguided but adorable belief in meaning, or even the sudden development of some semblance of a personality cannot save you.</p>

<p>You cannot be saved.</p>

      <p>Hello everyone, my name is David and I would like to tell you a story that started two years ago. Back in 2016 when ManageIQ was running on Rails 4.2 and the Rails 5 was in beta was when I started looking into <a href="https://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2015/12/18/Rails-5-0-beta1/">ActionCable</a> and WebSockets in general. I had this vision of having asynchronous notifications being emitted from long-running backend jobs that we could display on the frontend as notifications. In the meantime I had some bugs assigned to me about browser-based remote consoles. As you can guess, these consoles were also powered by WebSockets and I had a feeling that I could do some improvements in the area.</p>
